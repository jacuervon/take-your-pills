## TakeMED

### What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

My program, "TakeMED," aims to address the challenge of effectively tracking medication intake.
It will provide users with the ability to check whether they have taken their current medication
and consult the next scheduled medications. Additionally, it will prioritize user privacy by
encrypting user information, ensuring the security of health-related data.

### What will you learn from developing this program?

By developing this program, I will gain insights into libraries such as "cryptography" in Python,
data manipulation in JSON format, and the skill to securely preserve user information.
These learnings will encompass advanced techniques in encryption and decryption,
as well as effective strategies for managing and safeguarding sensitive data.

### What Python modules will your program use?

My program, "TakeMED," will utilize various Python modules, including "json" for data manipulation,
"cryptography" for data encryption, "os" for system operations, "datetime" for managing time-related
information, "random" for generating random values, and "pytest" for creating tests.
These modules will synergistically integrate to achieve a robust and functional implementation.
